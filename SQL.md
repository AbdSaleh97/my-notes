- Relational databases are like organized collections of data stored in tables, where each table has rows and columns. These databases use relationships between tables to link related information together.

    SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language used to communicate with these databases. It's like a universal tool that lets you ask questions about your data, add new information, update existing records, and remove data you no longer need. SQL makes it easier for humans to work with databases by providing a common language that works across different systems.

    So, in simple terms, relational databases help keep our data organized, and SQL is the language we use to talk to them and get the answers we need.
